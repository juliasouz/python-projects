# Python Projects

## Repository Overview

This repository contains four distinct Python projects, each designed to address specific tasks and demonstrate various programming skills.

### 1. Data Analysis with Pandas
- **Description**: This project is designed to analyze sales data and generate visualizations using Pandas and Plotly Express. It processes data from an Excel file, performs various analyses, and creates interactive histograms to visualize sales performance by different categories.
- **Key Features**: Data loading and inspection, statistical analysis, sales count analysis, revenue calculation, pdf and HTML export using interactive histograms.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Openpyxl, Plotly.

### 2. Automate Tasks Project
- **Description**: This project automates the process of fetching stock data, analyzing it, and sending an email with the analysis results. It uses various Python libraries to handle data retrieval, automation of browser actions, and email composition.
- **Key Features**: Email automation, file management, data analysis.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, yfinance, pyautogui, time, webbrowser, pyperclip.

### 3. Salary Calculator
- **Description**: This project is a Salary Calculator application built using Tkinter, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. The application calculates the net salary based on user inputs such as hours worked, hourly rate, overtime hours, overtime rate, and deductions.
- **Key Features**: User input handling, salary calculation, error handling and graphical user interface.
